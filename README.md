bash-studies
============

Well, the name is pretty much self-explanatory

In each of my scripts there will be a little intro where you can find an explanation on how to use a script
I'm quite new to writing scripts in bash, so if you know some material that is worth studying let me know please

If you intend to use launch_tests.sh please note, that it expects entry functions of the files to be:
- 'main' for '.c' files
- 'ldv_main0_sequence_infinite_withcheck_stateful' for '.o.i' files
